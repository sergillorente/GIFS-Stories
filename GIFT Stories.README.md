Sign up and be part of those who think that life it's a whole where funny moments are also essential :smile:.



## MVP (Minumum Viable Product)

The **MVP** includes:

- **Homepage**: It will include the menu where you'll be able to navigate throught the other pages. As well, it will introduce the idea of this project as long as a brief introduction to the *GIFS* world. :keyboard:

  - **Selection**: Over there is where the *Rock & Roll* begins. The 4 categories *family* :family:, *work* :hammer:, *friends* :popcorn: and *sports* :horse_racing:. Pick one and simply and enjoy. (You will find each category linked to the initial animation. The menu icon with its links which allow the easy navigation to the other pages.)

  - **Sign up**: It's time to join the community and be part of those who think that there's more than hard work. :dancer: (A registration form composed by 4 gaps which need to be filled and that will serve as a recognition for further entries to this app.):registered:.

  - **Log in**: Already on of us :vulcan_salute:! (A form where to access to your own profile. It needs the fulfillment of the email and its password.)

    

## Backlog

- Another page where **FAQs** are the order of business :business_suit_levitating:. Increase the functionality among the 5 pages, faster interaction and an improvement on the visual aspects of the app.

- An stricter validation process.

- A log out process.
